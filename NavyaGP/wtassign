				The historical perspectives on cross-cultural studies outlined in the following HISTORICAL pages are based on Negandhi [1975] and England, Negandhi, and Wilpert [1979]. PERSPECTIVE The emerging field of cross-cultural studies on organizational functioning is largely a result of partial integration between the cross-cultural comparative management field and organization theory areas

					A description list is perfect for defining terms.Although some cross-cultural organization studies were conducted prior to the 1950s, the large-scale projects on industrialization of developing countries at 4 major universities (MIT,Chicago, California, and Princeton) during the 1950s provided a major impetus to the comparative management area. Scholars from various social disciplines-psychology, sociology, social and cultural anthropology, economics, and political sciences-contributed toward these efforts. The differing backgrounds of these scholars are reflected in their conceptualizations and methodologies as well as in their specific findings [Harbison and Myers 1959]. The conceptual and methodological approaches used by the comparative management theorists can be divided roughly into the following groups: the economic development orientation; the environmental approach; and the behavioral approach. The concern for economic development can be traced to the initial large-scale proj- Economic ects undertaken in the 1950s at the 4 universities noted above. The basic premise Development was simple: managerial input plays an important role in achieving rapid industrial Orientation and economic development in underdeveloped countries. The approach was essentially a macro or aggregate approach, and, accordingly, it concentrated on the examination of basic trends of managerial development rather than analysis of specific management practi_es at the micro or firm level.
